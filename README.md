## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nfl_injury_analysis.git
cd nfl_injury_analysis
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Download the required data:
```bash
python scripts/download_injury_data.py
```

2. Process the data:
```bash
python run_processing.py
```

3. Generate visualizations:
```bash
python run_visualizations.py
```
The visualizations will be saved in the `reports/figures/` directory.

4. Explore the data using Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
